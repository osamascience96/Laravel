# Important Notes for Laravel

## Installation
To install Laravel, the following is required:
1. First Install the PHP (You can install php from xampp or lampp, if you want the additional server that is good).
2. Download and install the Composer
	- The **Composer** can be defined as a dependency manager or package manager that allows the developer to install the dependencies for the project.
        - This utility is like pip for python, npm for node etc.
3. Download the laravel installer
	- **CMD:** **composer** global require laravel/installer
4. To create a new Project
	- **CMD:** laravel new [project_name] optional_params [--dev]

## Artisan
Artisan is a tool that is used when the laravel is installed, in simple, when we create any project in laravel, this is the command line system for the laravel project. There are couple of commands that can help you in the laravel project, few of the examples are as under:
1. php artisan
	- This **command** is used to check the commands that we can execute with the artisan in laravel project.
2. php artisan serve
	- This **command** is used to run the php project. And you will see the link for the running server, it means that you don't need the xampp server in order to run this project.
3. php artisan --version
	- This **command** is used to check the version of the laravel.
